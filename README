Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------
Once you clone this repository, you'll have to also:

git submodule update --init --recursive

to get the code in ITKHelpers/ and ITKHelpers/Helpers/ that this code relies on.

NOTE: Although it depends on the ITKHelpers repository, this repository does not currently depend on the VTKHelpers repository.

Building
--------
This repository does not depend on any external libraries. The only caveat is that it depends
on c++0x/11 parts of the c++ language. For Linux, this means it must be built with the flag
gnu++0x. For Windows, we are working on finding the comparable solution/flag.

Usage
-----
This repository contains functions that allow easy interfacing between VTK and ITK data structures.
Everything is in a ITKVTKHelpers namespace, and can therefore be used as follows:

#include "ITKVTKHelpers.h"

vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints> points = vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints>::New();
// ... fill points ...

std::vector<itk::Index<2> > indexList = ITKVTKHelpers::PointsToPixelList(points);
